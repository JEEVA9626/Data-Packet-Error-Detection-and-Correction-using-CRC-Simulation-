CRC Error Detection and Correction Simulation

A web-based simulation of Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) error detection and correction.

Features
- Calculates CRC for given data and divisor
- Simulates errors in data transmission
- Checks for errors in received data

Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/crc-error-detection.git`
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Enter data and divisor, then calculate CRC
4. Simulate an error or check for errors in received data

How it Works
1. *CRC Calculation*: The simulation calculates the CRC for the given data and divisor using the CRC algorithm.
2. *Error Simulation*: The simulation introduces random errors into the data to mimic real-world transmission errors.
3. *Error Detection*: The simulation checks the received data for errors by recalculating the CRC and comparing it with the original CRC.

Limitations
- This is a simplified implementation of CRC and may not be suitable for production use.
- The simulation assumes a basic understanding of CRC and error detection.

Future Development
- Implement more advanced CRC algorithms and polynomials
- Add support for different data formats and transmission protocols
